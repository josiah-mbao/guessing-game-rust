# Guessing Game (Rust)

This is a simple number guessing game written in Rust, based on [The Rust Programming Language Book (Chapter 2)](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html).

## How it works

- The computer randomly picks a number between 1 and 100.
- You try to guess it.
- The game tells you whether your guess is too high, too low, or correct.

## What I learned

- Basic Rust syntax and project setup
- Reading input from the terminal
- Using `rand` crate for random number generation
- Pattern matching with `match`
- Type conversion and error handling

## How to run

```bash
cargo run
